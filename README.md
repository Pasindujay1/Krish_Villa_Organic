 Agriculture plays an important role in the economy of the country. Organic Agriculture is 
one of main element of those. Organic Agriculture combines tradition, innovation and science to benefit a 
good quality of life for all involved. Mr. Krishantha Jayawardena, who owns Krish Villa Organic is 
visionary person who having a mindset about “Healthy People, Healthy Living”. Krish Villa Organic is 
registered as a partnership under the companies Act and further is involved in selling organic vegetables 
and fruits. The company has their own farms located in Colombo and Lindula. Krish villa also has registered 
suppliers who themselves are organic farmers mainly in Horana, Bandaragama, NuwaraEliya, 
Bandarawela, Lindula and also few areas in the Monaragala district. 
 With the increasing demand for organic vegetables and fruits across the country, Krish 
Villa is needed a website for their organization to establish credibility in organic food industry. Though 
company has social networking sites, website will be the center of online presence. Further, buying and 
selling process is extremely difficult process to manage. Biggest difficulty is to manage the inventory. 
Currently Krish Villa is facing these problems. Everyone is squeezed for time in the modern world and 
majority of people are finicky when it comes to visit a store or farm. Therefore, online store and online 
ordering process is needed for Krish Villa to manage the customers efficiently and stay ahead of the 
competition. 
 To conquer the above facts, Krish Villa is needed a web-based application along with a 
company website. The proposed web application will greatly be simplifying the online ordering process for 
customer as well as purchasing organic foods and fruits from other farmers. Besides that, this application
will cater for managing customer orders who visit the farm and buy foods from Krish Villa. Further, 
proposed application will be fully feasible for managing the inventory effectively allowing Krish Villa 
admin to see the real time available inventory. The system will be strictly controlled by the admin but 
Customers , Farmers and Delivery Person can register themselves and see their relevant information where 
admin can manage. Apart from the web application, proposed solution will be included a fully responsive 
web site including an online order portal. Web application access will be routed through the website in 
order to spread the needed of organic food industry among Krish Villa users , customer, Farmers and 
Delivery persons. 
Proposed system will be developed using latest and matured technologies within the MVC 
(Model-View-Controller) architecture.
